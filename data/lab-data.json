      "abstract": "The standard \"pre-training and fine-tuning\" approach for graph models often fails due to the diversity of graph tasks, leading to poor performance. Inspired by prompt learning in NLP, we introduce a multi-task prompting method for graphs. Our approach unifies graph and language prompts, reformulates various downstream problems into graph-level tasks, and uses meta-learning to find a strong, general-purpose prompt initialization. Experiments confirm our method's superiority over existing techniques.",
